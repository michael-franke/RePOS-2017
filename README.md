# RePOS-2017
Replication, Preregistration &amp; Open Science

Established practices of experimental work and scientific publishing have recently come under attack by “methodological terrorists” who call for offensive replication of existing studies, for preregistration of experimental projects and for various aspects of openness in science. This course will have a theoretical and a practical part. In the theoretical first part, we will have a look at the arguments for a reorientation in experimental research practices, and at the counter-arguments levelled against such a reorientation. In the practical second part, students will work in groups on a small-scale replication project in order to get first-hand experience with reproducibility of published results and preregistration of experimental work on open science platforms. Basic knowledge of statistics is presupposed.
